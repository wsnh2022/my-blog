# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is my first blog post.

## What is this blog about?

This is a markdown-based blog where each `.md` file becomes a separate blog post. You can write your thoughts, ideas, and experiences here.

## Features

- **Simple & Clean** - Easy to read and navigate
- **Markdown Support** - Write in markdown format
- **Fast Loading** - No database needed, just static files
- **Easy to Update** - Just add new `.md` files

## Getting Started

To add more blog posts:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `public/posts` folder
2. Write your content in markdown format
3. The blog will automatically display it

## Example Markdown

Here's some example markdown syntax:

### Headings
Use `#` for headings

### Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code Blocks

console.log("Hello, World!");
```
